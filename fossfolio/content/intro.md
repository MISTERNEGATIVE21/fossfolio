## Hey there! This is Anuran! üëã {: .px-5 .py-3 .font-bold .text-3xl}
A generalist by nature, I love creating tools that people find value in- a habit built into me by the Open Source Communities and Organizations I am a part of. I love building robust, intelligent and privacy-focused systems that help people in various walks of life ‚ù§Ô∏è. I also love to contribute to causes that matter, just like Coronasafe. ‚ú®

My technical know-how is scattered across Blockchain/Web3, Data Science and Machine/Deep Learning, Full Stack Web Development, Inferential Statistics, and Natural Language Processing.

I also love to write (as apparent from this long bio üòÜ) and am a part of quite a few communities - Tezos Developer's Community Vellore (Community Lead), DataKind Bengaluru (Junior Member), Indian Linux User's Group, Delhi (Member) being some of them.
