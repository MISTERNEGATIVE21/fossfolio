   Hey there! This is Anuran! üëã
  </h2>
  <p class="px-5 py-4 text-lg font-red">
   A generalist by nature, I love creating tools that people find value in- a habit built into me by the Open Source Communities and Organizations I am a part of. I love building robust, intelligent and privacy-focused systems that help people in various walks of life ‚ù§Ô∏è. I also love to contribute to causes that matter, just like Coronasafe. ‚ú®
  </p>
  <p class="px-5 py-4 text-lg font-red">
   My technical know-how is scattered across Blockchain/Web3, Data Science and Machine/Deep Learning, Full Stack Web Development, Inferential Statistics, and Natural Language Processing.
  </p>
  <p class="px-5 py-4 text-lg font-red">
   I also love to write (as apparent from this long bio üòÜ) and am a part of quite a few communities - Tezos Developer's Community Vellore (Community Lead), DataKind Bengaluru (Junior Member), Indian Linux User's Group, Delhi (Member) being some of them.
