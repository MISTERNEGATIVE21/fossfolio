<h2>Hey there! This is Anuran! 👋</h2>
<p>A generalist by nature, I love creating tools that people find value in- a habit built into me by the Open Source Communities and Organizations I am a part of. I love building robust, intelligent and privacy-focused systems that help people in various walks of life ❤️. I also love to contribute to causes that matter, just like Coronasafe. ✨</p>
<p>My technical know-how is scattered across Blockchain/Web3, Data Science and Machine/Deep Learning, Full Stack Web Development, Inferential Statistics, and Natural Language Processing.</p>
<p>I also love to write (as apparent from this long bio 😆) and am a part of quite a few communities - Tezos Developer's Community Vellore (Community Lead), DataKind Bengaluru (Junior Member), Indian Linux User's Group, Delhi (Member) being some of them. </p>
<p>Got a new idea? Do hit me up!</p>
